# GOG Radensuaso

## Introduction

This was a Friday Challenge in the Strive School Course, to do a clone of the game shop website gog.com. I decided to polish it as much as I could, with the knowledge I have in the moment, throughout the the next weekends.
In the beginning it was everything hard coded, but later I decided to programmatically generate every card and the table contents with Javascript.
